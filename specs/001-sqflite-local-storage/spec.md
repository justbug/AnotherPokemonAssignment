# Feature Specification: SQLite Local Favorites Persistence

**Feature Branch**: `001-sqflite-local-storage`  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "替換 @LocalPokemonService 的 SharedPreferences 實作，改由 sqflite 實作，必須維持 LocalPokemonServiceSpec 介面"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Favorites Persist Reliably (Priority: P1)

As a returning Pokémon Trainer using the mobile app, I want my favorites list to
stay intact across app restarts and updates so that I can immediately see the
Pokémon I care about without re-marking them.

**Why this priority**: Favorites retention underpins daily engagement; losing the
list erodes trust and leads to churn.

**Independent Test**: Clear app state, mark a set of favorites, restart or force
close the app on both platforms, and verify the favorites list loads with the
same members and order within three seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has marked multiple Pokémon as favorites, **When** they
   restart the app, **Then** the favorites tab and inline heart indicators match
   the saved selections.
2. **Given** a user upgrades to a build containing the new storage mechanism,
   **When** they open the favorites tab for the first time, **Then** all prior
   favorites appear without delay or manual intervention.

### User Story 2 - Operations Maintain Favorite Data (Priority: P2)

As a product support analyst, I need a reliable way to inspect and clear local
favorite records during troubleshooting so that I can replicate user states and
offer guided recovery when data becomes inconsistent.

**Why this priority**: Supportability prevents prolonged incidents and enables
faster triage for parity or persistence issues reported by the field.

**Independent Test**: Start with a known favorites dataset, trigger storage
clear/reset via internal tooling or QA scripts, and confirm a predictable empty
state while audit logs capture the action.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a QA engineer needs to reset a corrupted local database, **When**
   they invoke the clear action, **Then** all favorites are removed and the list
   repopulates from remote data without leftover artifacts.
2. **Given** telemetry monitors persistence operations, **When** diagnostic tooling triggers a clear,
   **Then** the system records the operation outcome (success or failure) so support can review it.

### Edge Cases

- SQLite file creation fails due to lack of disk space or permissions.
- Shared data accessed simultaneously by background sync and UI reads.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The mobile app MUST persist LocalPokemon favorites using a
  SQLite-backed implementation that conforms to the existing
  `LocalPokemonServiceSpec` contract.
- **FR-002**: The app MUST initialize an empty SQLite favorites store on first launch (legacy SharedPreferences data is unsupported).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST guarantee idempotent insert/update semantics so
  that toggling favorite status updates a single authoritative record per
  Pokémon.
- **FR-004**: The app MUST expose a clear-all favorites maintenance pathway (QA
  menu, debug gesture, or automated script hook) that works against the SQLite
  store.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST surface actionable errors to the UI (e.g., toast,
  snackbar) if persistence actions fail, prompting the user to retry or contact
  support.
- **FR-006**: The app MUST emit analytics or diagnostic logs indicating the
  success or failure of persistence operations (insert, delete, clear) for
  support traceability.
- **FR-007**: The implementation MUST remain thread-safe so simultaneous reads
  and writes from UI and background tasks do not corrupt the SQLite database.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Local Pokemon Record**: Represents one locally stored Pokémon with fields
  `id`, `name`, `imageURL`, `isFavorite`, `created` timestamp, plus any future
  metadata; remains consistent between Flutter and Swift clients.
- **Diagnostics Event**: Structured log or analytics payload capturing
  persistence outcomes, database version, and error codes for observability.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of newly favorited Pokémon persist across app restarts during
  normal operation (validated via automated tests and beta telemetry).
- **SC-002**: Post-release telemetry shows zero reported incidents of missing
  favorites attributable to the SQLite layer during the first release week.
- **SC-003**: Clearing and reloading favorites completes within three seconds on
  mid-tier devices, keeping perceived responsiveness unchanged from current
  behavior.
- **SC-004**: Support teams can retrieve persistence telemetry for any device
  session within 24 hours of occurrence.

## Assumptions

- Users are online during the first launch after install, allowing remote data
  refresh if local cache is empty.
- The constitution’s parity requirements apply: Swift and Flutter clients adopt
  equivalent storage behaviors within the same release window.
- Existing automated tests for LocalPokemonService can be extended to cover the
  new persistence layer without rewriting the interface.

## Dependencies

- Alignment with backend contract to ensure favorite-related payloads remain
  unchanged while the new persistence layer rolls out.
- Coordination with release management to schedule user communications if
  persistence issues are detected during beta testing.
